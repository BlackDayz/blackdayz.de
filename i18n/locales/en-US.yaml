The new challenge was to work with a separate front-end and back-end system. Previously, I had only been able to try this out in my internship project. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to set up the project completely, so I created a video of the site in the development environment."

However, after around 68 hours of development time, it became too much for me outside of school. Since then, the project has been dormant in its current state. There are many design and code bugs, and the data and code security is not optimal. In addition, the code structure is not very customised, which makes it difficult to move to a new environment. Nevertheless, it was the first time I had developed a shop and I had to teach myself everything, as with all my previous projects. My plan to refresh this project is to run it entirely in the backend with the PHP framework CodeIgniter."

For this reason, I decided to start everything from scratch and pay more attention to the code structure and organisation. There are a few gimmicks hidden in the settings, such as switching error messages on and off, JavaScript animations, cookie settings and a dark mode."
