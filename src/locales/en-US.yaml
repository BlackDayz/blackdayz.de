There are many design and code bugs, and the data and code security is not optimal. In addition, the code structure is not very customised, which makes it difficult to move to a new environment. Nevertheless, it was the first time I had developed a shop and I had to teach myself everything, as with all my previous projects. My plan to refresh this project is to run it entirely in the backend with the PHP framework CodeIgniter."
