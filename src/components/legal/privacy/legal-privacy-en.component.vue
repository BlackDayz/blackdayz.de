                    <li>
                        The processing is unlawful, the affected person opposes the deletion of personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the personal data.

                        The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the affected person needs it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

They also have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data has been provided, provided that the processing is based on consent according to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR or on a contract according to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

                    Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European legislator to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning them, which is based on Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR, on grounds relating to their particular situation.

                    BlackDayz will no longer process the personal data in the event of an objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the affected person, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

                <p>
                    If BlackDayz processes personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, the affected person has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of such marketing. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the affected person objects to BlackDayz regarding the processing for the purposes of direct marketing, BlackDayz will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.

                    Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing — including profiling — that produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them, unless the decision (1) is necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between the affected person and the controller, or (2) is permitted by Union or member state law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the affected person, or (3) is based on the explicit consent of the affected person.

            7. Legal Basis for Processing
        </h4>
        <p>
            Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations where we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract to which the affected person is a party, such as in processing operations necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The same applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures, such as in cases of inquiries regarding our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR. In rare cases, processing of personal data may be necessary to protect vital interests of the affected person or another natural person. This would be the case if a visitor in our establishment were to be injured and, as a result, their name, age, health insurance data, or other vital information had to be disclosed to a doctor, a hospital, or other third parties. In this case, the processing would be based on Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations may be based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. This legal basis applies to processing operations not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases when the processing is necessary for the protection of legitimate interests of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the affected person do not outweigh those interests. Such processing operations are permitted, particularly because they are specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this regard, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the affected person is a customer of the controller (Recital 47, Sentence 2 GDPR).

        <p>
            If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.

        <p>
            The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the retention period has expired, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted, provided that they are no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of the contract.

        <p>
            We inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or may also arise from contractual arrangements (e.g., information about the contractual partner). Sometimes, it may be necessary for the conclusion of a contract that an affected person provides us with personal data that must then be processed by us. The affected person is obligated to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with them. Failure to provide personal data would mean that the contract with the affected person could not be concluded. Before providing personal data, the affected person must contact one of our employees. Our employee will clarify on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of personal data is required by law or contract for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data, and what the consequences of not providing the personal data would be.
